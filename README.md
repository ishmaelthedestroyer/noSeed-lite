# noSeed-lite

This is a starter MEAN template (MongoDB + ExpressJs + AngularJs + NodeJs) for quickly prototyping web applications.

<br />

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo into a directory on your computer by typing `git clone` followed by this project's url into a terminal. <br />
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project's root directory. <br />
3. Go into the `/config` folder and specify the routes to your development and production databases in the `/config/mongo*` and `/config/redis*` files. <br />
4. Start the server by typing `node app.js` into a terminal while in the project's root directory.

<br />

* When you start the server, if you add the option `--environment=production` then your models will connect to your production database. If you leave it out or specify `--environment=development`, they will connect to the development databases you specify in the mongo and redis configuration files.

<br />

* When you start the server, if you add the option `--useSSL=true`, then the server will load the certificates found in the `config/ssl/**` folders and force all traffic to https.
